## e-Auction Web Application

The purpose of the project was to create an auction web application, which would have all of the
necessary functionality of this type of a system, like uploading, editing an auction with dynamic
quantity of items in it. To have an option for seller to sell a product as an auction or a regular
item. Users would be able to place bids in real time on a desired item and win the mentioned
item during a specified time by a seller. Also a page where seller could manage products and a
page where administrator could manage a website.

Before a creating an auction system a thorough analysis was done on similar web systems in Lithuania 
and international markets, so it would be clear what functionality is a necessity and what could be 
changed in order to make it better. The analysis helped to create a theoretical model which would help 
to think of necessary tasks to create the system.
